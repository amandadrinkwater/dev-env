If you want, I can add minOut safeguards + gas estimation and emit a JSON execution report (pools, reserves, quotes, balances) to disk after each run.

Add more tokens or dynamic pair discovery.

Include multi-hop swaps (e.g., WETH → DAI → USDC → WETH).

Automatically encode params for FlashloanContract using the encodeParamsArray() helper.

Simulate profit and gas costs locally to refine MEV strategy.

I can also provide a full ready-to-run multi-hop arbitrage simulation, integrating:

Flashloan

Multi-token swap sequence

Arbitrage detection

Logging of pools, balances, and profits

merge this Flashbots MEV simulation with the arbScanner.cjs so the bot automatically detects arbitrage opportunities and sends simulated bundles in one workflow.

I can now add Uniswap V3 support to this same framework, so it can include V3 quoting and swaps in arbitrage detection, fully automated.
